## HTML Basics

### 1. HTML Document Structure
Every HTML document follows a standard structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Common HTML Tags
| Tag           | Description                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `<html>`      | Root element of an HTML page                 |
| `<head>`      | Contains metadata and links to styles/scripts|
| `<body>`      | Contains the visible content of the webpage  |
| `<h1>` to `<h6>` | Heading levels, `<h1>` being the largest     |
| `<p>`         | Paragraph                                    |
